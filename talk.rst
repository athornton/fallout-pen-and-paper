I run multiple pen-and-paper role-playing games (henceforth, RPGS).

Earlier this year, I wrapped up a game for my face-to-face St. Louis
group.

They said that they would like to play something like Fallout next.

After kicking around some options, we decided, why not just play a
Fallout RPG?  It's not like I'm going to try to sell it.

- At least not without filing off the serial numbers.

What's an RPG? (obligatory slide)
#################################

Really?  Is there anyone here who actually needs me to tell you this?

You should read Jon Peterson's *Playing At The World* anyway.
You will learn new things.

- https://playingattheworld.blogspot.com/

Quick history:

- *Braunstein*

- *Dungeons and Dragons*

- The 80s, pop phenomenon, Satanic Panic, and backlash

 - Early CRPGs

 - Crash (analogous to Video Game Crash of '84)

- Mainstreaming of nerdiness

- OSR/DIY

----

Computer RPGs
#############

We didn't always have free worldwide videoconferencing, you know.

Especially in small towns it could be hard to find a game.

Computer games were the next best thing.

- *Zork*, Scott Adams, Infocom

- *Rogue*, *Wizardry*, *Ultima*, et cetera

- These diverged by the late 80s into "Adventure" and "CRPG" genres

Fallout
#######

Does anyone here need this slide either?

Spiritual successor of *Wasteland* (EA, 1988)

*Fallout*: 1997.

The *Fallout* I'm basing my game on is the set of more recent 3D Fallout
games: *Fallout 3* (2008), *Fallout: New Vegas* (2010), *Fallout 4*
(2015).

Post-apocalyptic retro-future.  Robots, tailfins, the Ink Spots.

Questions?

Not like I have answers.  But I'll do my best.
